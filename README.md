## Description

This project consists of three JavaScript programs aimed at different functionalities:

1. **Range Function**: This function generates an array of numbers within a specified range.
2. **Prime Checker**: It checks whether a given number is prime or not, and includes a function to filter prime numbers from an array.
3. **Swap Case**: This function swaps the case of each character in a given string.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply include these JavaScript files in your project or run them in a JavaScript environment.

## Usage

### Range Function
1. Import or include the `range.js` file in your project.
2. Use the `range(start, end)` function, where `start` and `end` are the desired range limits.
3. The function will return an array containing numbers from `start` to `end`.

### Prime Checker
1. Include the `prime.js` file in your project.
2. Utilize the `checkPrime(number)` function to determine if a number is prime.
3. Use the `filterPrimeNumbers(numbers)` function to filter out prime numbers from an array of numbers.

### Swap Case
1. Add the `swapCase.js` file to your project.
2. Call the `swapCase(string)` function, passing the string whose case needs to be swapped.
3. The function will return the string with each character's case swapped.
